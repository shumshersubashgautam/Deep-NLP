About Deep-NLP datasets
Sheet_1.csv contains 80 user responses, in the response_text column, to a therapy chatbot. Bot said: 'Describe a time when you have acted as a resource for someone else'.  User responded. If a response is 'not flagged', the user can continue talking to the bot. If it is 'flagged', the user is referred to help.

Sheet_2.csv contains 125 resumes, in the resume_text column. Resumes were queried from Indeed.com with keyword 'data scientist', location 'Vermont'. If a resume is 'not flagged', the applicant can submit a modified resume version at a later date. If it is 'flagged', the applicant is invited to interview.
